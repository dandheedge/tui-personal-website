I specialize in crafting performant, accessible, and beautiful user interfaces.
My journey spans from digital agency campaigns to blockchain infrastructure,
always focusing on developer experience and clean code.

Currently working with modern JavaScript frameworks, blockchain technologies,
and GraphQL APIs. I keep learning about new ideas and technologies in the
web industry and strive to keep up with the latest tools.
